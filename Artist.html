<h1>This is my artist statment.</h1>
<p>I like to make things digitally. I found that I really enjoy making effects and things move on a screen. I want to create interactive art that has a visual element that is fun. Whether it is with animating visual effects or creating interesting visuals. My overall vision isn't to make statements but to create  intereactive pieces that give a sense of wonder. I would like to use art as a way to explore environments and scenarios that I find interesting. My insperation for art are from; games like Journey and Abzu, VR experiences, and an art piece I remember seeing when I was a kid. My philosophy of art is that it should be fun/interesting for the viewer and that means it doesn't have to have a deeper message. However, I do believe art should have a statment if it is applicable.
</p><p>
I have experince with animation in adobe animate. I also know how to use it to make intereactive things in animate. I recently learned how to code very lightly. I can make things like this page you are viewing right now and things you see in the portfolio. The methods I use for art is to build or take something and break it down and rebuild it. This can be seen in my 3D Mashup piece which is like a collage of things I found and made. My current art works are like building art from scraps I found and add my own pieces when I can.
</p><p>
  In conclusion, my goal is to create interactive art. I don't think art has to have a deeper meaning to it, but it has to be interesting. Having fun with art pieces is my end goal.
