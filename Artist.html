<h1>This is my artist statment.</h1>
<p>I like to make things digitally. I found that I really enjoy making effects and things move on a screen. I want to create interactive art that has a visual element that is fun. Whether it is with animating visual effects or creating interesting visuals. My goal with my art isn't to make statements, but to make cool digital art for almost anyone who has the technology for it.<br>
I have experince with animation in adobe animate. I also know how to use make intereactive things in animate. I recently learned how to code very lightly. I can make things like this page you are viewing right now and things you see in the portfolio.</p>
